# Todo / Tasklist
- [ ] Implement Hidden Markov Models
- [ ] Implement alternative Full Measurement Anomaly Detection Methods
- [ ] Finish README
- [ ] Restructering Code
  - [ ] Something Here



# Introduction
PhD Project for predicting maintenance for robots. Currently focussed on anomaly detection.

# Data

## VDL ABB Data
The data is a testing done once a week between the period TODO :warning:. The number of ABB robots included in these test where TODO :warning:. There were different types and different amount of test where executed. The overview of the actual data that has been gathered is given in the table TODO :warning:. Problem with the data is that the labeling is at best incomplete, but realistically not there. It is now become almost impossible to get better labels, since the company has been dissolved, the data has been destroyed.


## UM EDMO Data
This data was gathered to get labeled data compared to the data of VDL Nedcare. Anomalies in this dataset where introduced physically, 


# Syntethic Anomaly Injection

# Methods

## Approach

## Single Measurement Anomaly Detection

### Statistical Methods (Z-score & MZ-score)
### Local Outlier Factor
### Isolation Forests

## Full Measurement Anomaly Detection

### Normalized Summation Approaches




# Code
There are 3 parts to the code, coding specific for the ABB robots, code specific for the EDMO robot and then a shared coding base that is used for both.
